#Firebug Net Dump Structure Tool

To help get this working, the only way I could seem to do it was to dump the files the production version of the origional Cloud9IDE was using and serving up - Obviously some Node.JS processing I didn't have to time to look into!

This script takes the .har files from a Firebug export of the Net tab and turns them into a worksable directory structure.

It was only a 10 min job, so it's very buggy, but thought it was worth including for future reference.
