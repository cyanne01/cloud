The new backend is based on CodeIgniter.

To install, copy the files inside the src directory to your web root.

Create a MySQL database and run create.sql on it from the sql folder.

Edit the cloud9php/config/database.php file and fill it with your MySQL settings.

That's all set up.

For the moment, there is no easy way to create a user to help you login.

An install script is on the way and will be available soon.
